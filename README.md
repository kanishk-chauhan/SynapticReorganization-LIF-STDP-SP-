## Synaptic reorganization of synchronized neuronal networks with synaptic weight and structural plasticity
Author summary: Synaptic weight and structural plasticity of neuronal networks determine their behavior, and abnormalities therein may underlie disordered states. Studying how different plasticity mechanisms govern network dynamics, particularly during (de)synchronization processes, holds clinical importance concerning, e.g., Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The marked difference between the timescales at which neuronal spiking activity (milliseconds), synaptic weight modifications (minutes-hours), and structural changes (hours-days) occur in the brain makes plastic network models computationally expensive, which may limit the scope of studies. Here, we present a leaky integrate-and-fire fire (LIF) neuron network model with a standard spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule for weight plasticity and a stochastic structural plasticity (SP) method. The model is computationally efficient, allowing for detailed numerical analyses of network dynamics and structure. Combining the model with tools from network science, we show that structural reorganization resulting from SP can optimize the network for synchronization, elevating the level of synchrony while concurrently reducing overall network connections. This leads to the emergence of structural correlations between the natural firing rates of neurons and the number of their pre- and post-synaptic partners. Additionally, we demonstrate that synchronized networks that evolved with SP can be more robust against desynchronization stimulation.
